# Multiple-Variables-in-Linear-Regression
This code showcases the fundamental concepts behind linear regression and gradient descent, which are foundational techniques in machine learning and predictive modeling. Linear regression seeks to establish a linear relationship between input features and target values, while gradient descent is a powerful optimization algorithm used to iteratively adjust model parameters to minimize a cost function.

In this implementation, the code initializes the model parameters \( w \) and \( b \) and iteratively updates them using gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual target values. By computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters \( w \) and \( b \), the algorithm determines the direction in which to adjust these parameters to reduce the error.

The visualization of the cost function over iterations provides insight into the optimization process, showing how the algorithm converges towards the optimal values of \( w \) and \( b \). Through this iterative approach, the model learns from the data and improves its predictive accuracy, making it a crucial technique in regression analysis and predictive modeling tasks.

Overall, this code serves as a practical demonstration of linear regression and gradient descent, illustrating their application in solving real-world regression problems and laying the groundwork for more advanced machine learning algorithms.
